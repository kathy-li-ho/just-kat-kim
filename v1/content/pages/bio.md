      body: "I unabashedly love  [K-pop](https://www.allkpop.com \"Who is your bias?\").\n\nI am a Flushing, Queens native - the very place where my heart and my story begin.\n\nLike a good second generation Korean-American girl, I began my profession as an attorney  (big surprise!). While I am proud to join the bastion of attorneys in this profession, I felt my creative side atrophy. That is when I secretly began to write stories and mini scripts, and really thought back to the fond moments I had in my theater classes I took in college. In law school, I shined in competitions like mock trial, negotiations, arbitration. They made me feel so alive - because in essence, these were all performances!\n\nWell into my legal career, I was working at a big financial institution. To explore my creative side, I had the fortunate opportunity to co-write and produce an independent film. During the pre-production phase, I knew I had to make a bold move. I needed  (read: wanted) to be on my own set! That was impossible with a full-time job. I dove right in. So … I consciously uncoupled  (Chris Martin and Gwyneth Paltrow style) and set out to play the important role of producer. The film -  [Happy Cleaners](https://www.happycleanersfilm.com \"A Flushing narrative\")  - was met with great success, having toured in the film festival circuit in 2019 into 2020. My creative hunger was satiated.

I have enjoyed hosting gala events for non-profit organizations and appeared in promotional visual content:  [Resume](https://www.dropbox.com/s/fch7jwkt7xe05jl/KAT%20KIM%20-%20ACTOR%20RESUME%202020.pdf?dl=0 \"Working girl\").
