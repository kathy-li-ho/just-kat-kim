          I unabashedly love  [K-pop](https://www.allkpop.com "Who is your bias?").


          I am a Flushing, Queens native - the very place where my heart and my
          story begin.


          Like a good second generation Korean-American girl, I began my profession
          as an attorney  (big surprise!). While I am proud to join the bastion of
          attorneys in this profession, I felt my creative side atrophy. That is
          when I secretly began to write stories and mini scripts, and really
          thought back to the fond moments I had in my theater classes I took in
          college. In law school, I shined in competitions like mock trial,
          negotiations, arbitration. They made me feel so alive - because in
          essence, these were all performances!


          Well into my legal career, I was working at a big financial institution.
          To explore my creative side, I had the fortunate opportunity to co-write
          and produce an independent film. During the pre-production phase, I knew I
          had to make a bold move. I needed  (read: wanted) to be on my own set!
          That was impossible with a full-time job. I dove right in. So … I
          consciously uncoupled  (Chris Martin and Gwyneth Paltrow style) and set
          out to play the important role of producer. The film -  [Happy
          Cleaners](https://www.happycleanersfilm.com "A Flushing narrative")  - was
          met with great success, having toured in the film festival circuit in 2019
          into 2020. My creative hunger was satiated. However, that

          "Solution")  still remained - I needed to be in FRONT of the camera, not
          behind it!


          Fast forward to the present, I have had the pleasure of acting in a
          handful of short films, a few small-time commercials, background for major
          television shows, some off-off-Broadway productions, and even an
          instructional guide video for lawyers. I have enjoyed hosting gala events
          for non-profit organizations and appeared in promotional visual content:
